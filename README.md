Project for Udacity's FSND program. A single page application featuring a map of bay area's bubble tea places.

I used Foursquare's API to fetch bubble tea info.

I also referenced [this snippet](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/sidebar-responsive) this snippet for the responsive navbar.

To view the project, clone the repo and open ```index.html``` on a web browser.
